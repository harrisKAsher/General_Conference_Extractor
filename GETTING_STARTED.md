## üìã What You Need

- **Python 3.7+** (check with `python3 --version`)
- **Internet connection** (to download conference talks)
- **5 minutes** for setup and first run

---

## üìñ Detailed Instructions

### First Time Setup

1. **Open Terminal** and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Scripture_Extractor
   ```

2. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install required packages (reportlab)
   - Verify everything is working

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   You'll see `(venv)` appear in your terminal prompt.

### Generating Your First PDF

**Basic command:**
```bash
python generate_conference_pdf.py <conference_url>
```

**Example - April 2025 Conference:**
```bash
python generate_conference_pdf.py "https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04?lang=eng"
```

**What happens:**
1. Script connects to churchofjesuschrist.org
2. Downloads all talks from the conference
3. Generates a formatted PDF
4. Saves two files:
   - `2025_April.pdf` (the formatted document)
   - `2025_April_data.json` (raw data backup)

**Time:** About 1-2 minutes for a full conference

### Using a Custom Filename

```bash
python generate_conference_pdf.py <url> <filename>
```

**Example:**
```bash
python generate_conference_pdf.py "https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04?lang=eng" MyConference.pdf

## üìÅ What Gets Created

After running the script, you'll have:

```
Scripture_Extractor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025_April.pdf           ‚Üê Your formatted PDF
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025_April_data.json     ‚Üê Raw data (for debugging)
```

2. **Table of Contents** - All talks with speakers
3. **Individual Talks** - Each talk formatted with:
   - Speaker name
   - Talk title
   - Full content

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "command not found: ./setup.sh"
**Solution:** Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Problem: "python: command not found"
**Solution:** Use `python3` instead:
```bash
python3 generate_conference_pdf.py <url>
```

### Problem: "No module named 'reportlab'"
**Solution:** Activate virtual environment and install:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Problem: "HTTP Error 404"
**Solution:** Check the conference URL is correct. Format should be:
```
https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/YYYY/MM?lang=eng
```
Where YYYY is year and MM is month (04 or 10).

### Problem: Script is slow
**Solution:** This is normal! Downloading 30+ talks takes 1-2 minutes. You'll see progress messages.

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Always Activate Virtual Environment
Before running the script, always activate:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Tip 3: Batch Processing
Generate multiple conferences:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python generate_conference_pdf.py "https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04?lang=eng"
python generate_conference_pdf.py "https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10?lang=eng"
python generate_conference_pdf.py "https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/04?lang=eng"
```

When finished:
```bash
deactivate
```
