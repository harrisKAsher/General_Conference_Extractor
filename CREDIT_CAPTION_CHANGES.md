# Credit-Based Caption System

## Summary
Re-implemented the image caption system to use the credit text from `<div class="credit">` within figure elements instead of using the alt text or title attributes.

## Changes Made

### 1. conference_scraper.py
Modified the `extract_content_from_html()` method to:
- Extract credit text from `<div class="credit">` elements within `<figure>` tags using regex
- Create a mapping of image src URLs to their credit text
- Add a `credit` field to each image in the structured_content

**Key code changes:**
- Added regex pattern to find all `<figure>` elements
- For each figure, extract the image src and look for a credit div
- Strip HTML tags from credit text to get clean text
- Store credit in the image data structure

### 2. pdf_generator.py
Modified the image caption rendering in `_add_talk_to_story()` method to:
- Use `item.get('credit', '')` instead of `item.get('title') or item.get('alt', '')`
- Only show caption if credit text exists
- If no credit, skip caption entirely (no caption shown)

**Key code changes:**
- Changed line 700 from: `caption = item.get('title') or item.get('alt', '')`
- To: `caption = item.get('credit', '')`

## Behavior

### Images WITH credit div
- Caption is shown below the image
- Caption text comes from the `<div class="credit">` content
- Example: "Five Wise Virgins, by Ben Hammond"

### Images WITHOUT credit div
- No caption is shown
- Image appears without any text below it

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the implementation:
- `test_credit_extraction.py` - Tests credit extraction from HTML
- `test_pdf_with_credits.py` - Tests PDF generation with credit-based captions
- `verify_credit_system.py` - Comprehensive verification across multiple talks

### Test Results
From a sample of 24 images across 10 talks:
- 3 images had credit divs (captions shown)
- 21 images had no credit divs (no captions)

## HTML Structure
The credit information is found in this structure:
```html
<figure class="image no-print" id="fig_iSf0l">
  <img alt="..." src="..." />
  <div class="credit">
    <p><cite>Five Wise Virgins</cite>, by Ben Hammond</p>
  </div>
</figure>
```

## Backward Compatibility
The changes maintain backward compatibility:
- The `alt`, `title`, and `description` fields are still extracted and stored
- They're just not used for captions anymore
- Only the new `credit` field is used for captions
