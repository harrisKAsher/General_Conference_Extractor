## Technical Note

Bookmarks are embedded metadata in the PDF file. They:
- Don't affect the visual appearance of the PDF
- Don't increase file size significantly
- Are part of the PDF standard (supported everywhere)
- Work even when the PDF is printed (though they won't show on paper)

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see bookmarks in my PDF reader"
- Make sure you're opening the sidebar/navigation panel
- Some readers hide bookmarks by default
- Try a different PDF reader (Adobe Acrobat Reader is most reliable)

### "Old PDFs don't have bookmarks"
- Bookmarks were added in version 1.2
- Regenerate old PDFs to get bookmarks
- Or use the verification script to check

### "Can I customize bookmark names?"
- Currently, bookmarks use the format: "Speaker: Title"
- Session names are standard (Saturday Morning Session, etc.)
- Future versions may allow customization

## Example Use Cases

```
"I want to review all talks by Elder Holland"
→ Open bookmarks, scan for "Jeffrey R. Holland", click to jump
```
